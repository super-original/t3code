    'Create an ordinary TOP-LEVEL thread with an explicit workspace binding before its agent starts.

For upstream commits, set startFromOrigin:true. Omitted workspaceStrategy means the project root, NOT the caller\'s worktree. Omit projectId/modelSelection/modes to inherit those settings from the calling thread; a caller outside a T3 thread must pass projectId and gets the project\'s default model. Set scratch:true instead of projectId for a thread without a project: it runs in a fresh folder of its own, outside any repository. Put the task in message. Do not ask the agent to create its own worktree via shell: that does not update the thread binding. Pass clientRequestId to retry safely: the same key returns the thread the first call created instead of launching another. Retain threadId and use t3_thread_read/t3_thread_wait to follow preparation. Paste the returned link when you mention the thread. Attachments must be pending uploads. The new thread may not run with broader runtime or interaction modes than the caller: the calling T3 thread\'s own modes, or the permission mode an outside agent was approved with. Pass environmentId to launch in a linked environment; projectId and modelSelection then name that environment\'s project and providers (t3_project_list and orchestrator_capabilities with the same environmentId list them), and attachments are not supported.',
